        <h1>API Fun</h1>
		<p>describe the API you selected and what it does<br>
            The API I chose is a free dictionary online. It offers lots of data on each word but for this assignment I just chose to focus on the phonetics<br> <br>
        cite the website where you found it <br>
        I found the API on the github page for public APIs <a href="https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis#dictionaries" target="_blank">FREEAPIs</a> <br><br>
        describe the options you used for the API request<br>
        I found a free to use API so no key was needed.
        give two applications where this API would be helpful.<br>
        This would be useful to anyone who could read phonetics but didnt know how to pronounce a word. The list of random words could also be expanded or even made editable so one could enter a word and the phonetics would be returned. Then it would be useful for people who know english well just need to pronounce uncommon words.
